PROJECT AND TASK MANAGEMENT DETAILS:
When using the project management tools, keep in mind the following important details:

PROJECTS:
- Projects have a title (required, max 200 characters) and description (optional, max 2000 characters)
- Each project is identified by a unique UUID
- Projects track overall progress as a percentage (0-100)
- Projects maintain counts of total and completed tasks

TASKS:
- Tasks belong to a specific project and can have parent-child relationships for hierarchical organization
- Each task has a title (required, max 200 characters) and description (optional, max 2000 characters)
- Tasks have a complexity rating (1-10) used for breakdown decisions
- Tasks have a priority rating (1-10) with higher numbers indicating higher priority
- Tasks have a state that can be one of: pending, in-progress, completed, blocked, cancelled
- Tasks can be organized hierarchically with a maximum depth of 5 levels
- Each level of the hierarchy can contain up to 20 tasks (configurable limit)
- Tasks with a complexity of 8 or higher that have no subtasks are candidates for breakdown

PROGRESSION AND WORKFLOW:
- Start by creating a project with a clear title and description
- Break down projects into tasks with appropriate complexity and priority ratings
- Organize tasks hierarchically when they represent sub-components of larger features
- Regularly update task states to reflect current progress
- Use the find_next_actionable_task function to identify what should be worked on next
- Identify tasks that need breakdown using the find_tasks_needing_breakdown function
- Monitor project progress using the get_project_progress function

BEST PRACTICES:
- When creating tasks, provide meaningful titles and descriptions that clearly define what needs to be done
- Set appropriate complexity ratings based on the estimated effort required
- Use priority ratings to help team members understand the relative importance of tasks
- Regularly update task states to keep project progress accurate
- Break down complex tasks (complexity 8-10) into smaller subtasks to make them more manageable
- Use hierarchical task organization to represent the natural structure of projects

When coordinating project activities:
  - Focus on clear communication and documentation
  - Ensure tasks are well-defined with realistic timelines
  - Proactively identify and address potential blockers
  - Keep all stakeholders informed of project progress and changes
